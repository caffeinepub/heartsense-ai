  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to 14 files (backend main.mo, frontend components, pages, configs) but no evidence of a version control rollback to Version 6. The changes appear to be regular code updates rather than a complete codebase reversion as requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert the entire codebase to Version 6 state, discarding all changes made in versions 7 through 11",
      "reason": "The diff shows only 14 modified files with no indication of a git revert/reset operation. A complete codebase rollback to Version 6 would require version control evidence (git commits, tags, or history manipulation) and would likely affect more than 14 files. The changes appear to be regular code modifications rather than a rollback operation.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json (shows projectStateVersion: 3 and status: pending)",
        "All modified files show code changes rather than complete file replacements from Version 6"

    {
      "description": "Regular code modifications and updates to existing files",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states 'Must restore complete Version 6 codebase without any modifications' and 'Must not merge or cherry-pick features from versions 7-11'. However, the diff shows ongoing development work including modified components (AppFooter, AppHeader, WatermarkGuard), updated pages (AssessmentPage, LandingPage), and backend changes to main.mo. These are incremental modifications rather than a clean reversion to Version 6 state.",
